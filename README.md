## Project Description

**What it is?** ðŸ’¡ It's a resume from Machine Learning Specialization Course from Stanford, the Jovian Course Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn: Zero to GBMs and the Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs. **Why did you build this project?** ðŸ’¡ It was partly a bootcamp project to achieve the highest possible score in the E-commerce dataset. But I'll use it as a kaggle notebook repository. 

**What was my motivation?** ðŸ’¡ I know Python very well, but I'd like to have a solid foundation in supervise and unsupervise learning. On the other hand, it is a good starting point for Deep Learning and AI. **What did you learn?** ðŸ’¡ Libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and PyTorch; Machine Learning supervised learning, unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. Best practices for Jupyter notebooks. However, the gem of this repo is practical advice for using learning algorithms.

## How to run

### 1. Localy

* You'll need to fork and clone the repo.
* Create a env with `python3 -m venv ./venv` We can also use [**Conda**](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). 
* Let's install the requirements as follows `pip install -r requeriments/dev.txt`.
* To activate venv `source venv/bin/activate`.
* Run jupyter `jupyter-notebook` or `jupyter-lab`.
* To deactivate `deactivate`.

### 2. Streamlit
