## Project Description

**What it is?** ðŸ’¡ It's just a Machine Learning Specialization course from Stanford and Jovian Course. **Why did you build this project?** ðŸ’¡ I will learn the basics of ML and experiment with different approaches to different datasets from Kaggle.

**What was my motivation?** ðŸ’¡ I have a very good understanding of Python, but I really want to have a strong foundation in supervise and unsupervise algorithms. In the other hand it is a good started for Deep Learning and AI **What did you learn?** ðŸ’¡ Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning but the gold of this repo is a practical advice for applying learning algorithms.

## How to Install and Run the Project

### 1. Localy

* You'll need to fork and clone the repo.
* Create a env with `python3 -m venv ./venv` we also can use conda [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). and them let's install the requirements as follows `pip install -r requeriments/dev.txt`.
* To activate venv `source venv/bin/activate`.
* Run jupyter `jupyter-notebook`.
* To deactivate `deactivate`.
